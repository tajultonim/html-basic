	<h2> Introduction </h2>
	<p> HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) tags are fundamental building blocks of web pages. They consist of opening and
		closing elements enclosed in angle brackets, defining the structure and formatting of web content. HTML tags
		encompass various functions, including defining headings, paragraphs, images, links, and styling through CSS.
		These tags play a crucial role in organizing and presenting information on the web, serving as the core
		framework for web development and design. </p>

	<h2> Paragraph Tag </h2>
	<p> The <b> p </b> tag in HTML is used to define paragraphs of text on a web page. It automatically adds spacing
		before and after the text, making it a fundamental element for structuring and formatting written content. </p>
	<h2> Heading Tag </h2>
	<p> HTML heading tags are crucial for structuring and organizing content on web pages. They serve to define headings
		and subheadings, conveying a clear hierarchy to both human readers and search engines. The primary heading tag
		is <b> h1</b>, which represents the highest level of importance or the main title of a page. As the level of
		importance decreases, you can use <b>h2</b>, <b>h3</b>, and so on, down to <b>h6</b>, which indicates the lowest
		level of significance. </p>
	<p> Here's an overview of heading tags and their variations: </p>
	<ol>
		<li> <b>h1:</b> Typically used for the main page title, there should only be one <b>h1</b> per page. </li>
		<li> <b>h2:</b> Represents major section headings or subsections of the content. </li>
		<li> <b>h3:</b> Used to further subdivide content under <b>h2</b> headings. </li>
		<li> <b>h4, h5, and h6:</b> Continue the hierarchy, with <b>h6</b> being the least significant. </li>
	</ol>
	<h2> Anchor Tag </h2>
	<p> The anchor tag in HTML, denoted as <b>a</b>, is used to create hyperlinks, allowing users to navigate between
		web pages by clicking on linked text or images. It plays a crucial role in connecting and organizing content on
		the web. </P>
